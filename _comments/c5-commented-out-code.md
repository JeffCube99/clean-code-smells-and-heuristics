title: Commented-Out Code
---
It makes me crazy to see stretches of code that are commented out.
Who knows how old it is? Who knows whether or not it's meaningful?
Yet no one will delete it because everyone assumes someone else needs it or has plans for it.

That code sits there and rots, getting less and less relevant with every passing day.
It calls functions that no longer exist. It uses variables whose names have changed.
It follows conventions that are obsolete.
It pollutes the modules that contain it and distracts the people who try to read it.
Commented-out code is an abomination.
