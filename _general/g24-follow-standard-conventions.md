code: G24
title: Follow Standard Conventions
order: 24
---
Every team should follow a coding standard based on common industry norms.
This coding standard should specify things like where to declare instance variables; how to name classes, methods, and variables; where to put braces; and so on.
The team should not need a document to describe these conventions because their code provides examples.

Everyone on the team should follow these conventions.
This means that each team member must be mature enough to realize that it doesn't matter a white where you put your braces so long as you all agree on where to put them.

If you would lik to know what conventions I follow, you'll se them in the refactored code in Listing B-7 on page 394, through Listing B-14.
