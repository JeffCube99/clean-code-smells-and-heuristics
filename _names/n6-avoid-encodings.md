title: Avoid Encodings
order: 6

Names should not be encoded with type of scope information.
Prefixes such as `m_` or `f` are useless in today's environments.
Also project and/or subsystem encodings such as `vis_` (for visual imaging system) are distracting and redudant.
Again, today's environments provide all that information without having to mangle the names.
Keep your names free of Hungarian pollution.
