Coverage tools report gaps in your testing strategy.
They make it easy to find modules, classes, and functions that are insufficiently tested.
Most IDEs give you a visual indication, marking lines that are covered in green and those that are uncovered in red.
This makes it quick and easy to find `if` or `catch` statements whose bodies haven't been checked.
